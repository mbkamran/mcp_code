THIS IS A SINGLE CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE

This uses FastMCP 1.0 that is built inside of the official Python SDK of MCP from Anthropic in 2024
Documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction
Python SDK: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk

The purpose of FastMCP is to provide boiler code for fast and efficient creation of MCP applications, making it a standardized way of creating MCP applications

With the release of FastMCP 2.0, maintainance of the library is done independently, making it much more efficient. For documentation, visit:
